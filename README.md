# Generic Mini Max Algorith
This project is to create a generic solution to apply minimax algorithm to range of different use-cases.

The `Game` class uses `Minimax` algorithm at the core to loop on a collection states (e.g 3x3 or 4x4 Tic Tac Toe) and evaluate the wining status.

It is limited into two players at the moment but could be extened into multiple players.

##Note:## The Minimax depth search is limited into 2 levels to improve performance.s

Use the following site for experimenting with 4x4 Tac Tac Toe game.
